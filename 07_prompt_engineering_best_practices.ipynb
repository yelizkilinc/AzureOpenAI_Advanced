Therefore, the net profit is $3 million. Now, let's calculate the debt-to-equity ratio. To do that, we need to divide the debt by the equity. However, we don't have the equity information. Therefore, we need to calculate it. The equity is the difference between the assets and the liabilities. We don't have the assets information, but we have the debt information, which is a liability. Therefore, we can calculate the equity as follows: Equity = Assets - Liabilities = ? - $2 million. We don't know the assets, but we know that the equity is equal to the net profit plus the debt. Therefore, we can write the following equation: Equity = Net Profit + Debt = $3 million + $2 million = $5 million. Now, we can calculate the debt-to-equity ratio as follows: Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Debt / Equity = $2 million / $5 million = 0.4. Therefore, the debt-to-equity ratio is 0.4.\n\n"

The stock market performed well globally in 2023, especially early and late in the year.\n     - **Interest Rate Impact**: Due to falling interest rates in 2023 (unlike the sharp rises in 2022), the company made $66 million in profits from bonds and similar investments, compared to losing $1.2 billion in 2022.\n     - **Higher Investment Income**: The company earned $192 million more in 2023 simply because it reinvested money more effectively, took advantage of rising interest rates, and deployed funds from past transactions.\n     - **Other Investment Income**: Partnerships the company invested in started earning more, resulting in a $13 million gain, compared to losses of $74 million in 2022.\n\n2. **Other Income**:\n   - In 2023, the company earned $241 million from a one-time gain after transferring certain reinsurance policies.\n\n3. **Tax Improvements**:\n   - The company saved $238 million in taxes. This was mainly because:\n     - New tax laws allowed them to recognize a $205 million tax asset.\n     - They adjusted some tax rules in the U.S., increasing tax benefits by $25 million.\n\nOverall, better investment performance, a one-time income boost, and tax savings helped the company shift from a big loss in 2022 to a large profit in 2023.\n"
